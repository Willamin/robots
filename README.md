# Robots

An example of how to create apis with structs, maps, and keyword lists.

## What do I do?

1. Clone this repo
2. run `mix test`
3. Make the tests pass.

The tests are designed to give you an idea of how to structure the api. You should use them as reference.

## What do I do if I make all the tests pass?

Use your imagination! In case you don't have an imagination here are some ideas:

* Add more tests or functionality
* Print your robots movement to the console
* Build a simulation of robots and add interactions or collision detection
* Take said simulation and hook them up through phoenix channels and visualize everything with javascript
* If you don't wanna use phoenix then figure out how to distribute a robot simulation across BEAM nodes.
* Learn something awesome about Elixir.
